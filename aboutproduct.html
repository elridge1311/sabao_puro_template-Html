								One of the benefits of using real soap is that one of the by-products of
								the production process is
								glycerine. Glycerine is an excellent skin moisturiser because it attracts moisture to
								itself
								in and around
								the skin. Traditionally made soaps contain glycerine, and so they hydrate the skin
								during
								bathing, whereas
								many commercially manufactured soaps can dry skin out. Why? Because store-bought,
								commercial
								soaps usually
								undergo a process designed specifically to remove the glycerine.

							<p class="card-text">
								Mass-produced commercial soaps are made for efficiency of production, which means many,
								many, units of the
								exact same size and composition. Focus is on profit, often at the expense of the health
								of
								the consumers who
								pay for them. Organic bars are different in that they do vary slightly from bar to bar,
								just
								as natural
								ingredients vary slightly depending on a given year’s weather and other conditions.
								Where
								they do not vary,
								however, is in the lack of harmful ingredients and the abundance of healthy ones that
								are in
								each
								bar.

							<p class="card-text">
								Organic soaps do not produce harmful environmental poisons or toxins. The soap breaks
								down
								more easily
								after use and does not harm the water cycle or the wildlife that shares the water in our
								rivers, lakes, and
								the oceans. This eco-friendliness would be a strong argument for using organic soaps,
								even
								if all else was
								equal. Add to it the great quality and efficacy of the soaps, and the pleasure you get
								from
								a more unique
								product, and they are a clear winner.

							<p class="card-text">Since the ingredients used in organic soaps include many that are
								natural
								antioxidants, and since the
								process doesn’t extract these substances for other purposes, organic soaps can actually
								help
								to repair the
								skin by reducing inflammation, keeping skin hydrated, and therefore helping the user to
								have
								young-looking,
								healthier skin. The gentler pH levels of organic soaps help care for your skin in the
								long
								term, as well as
								keeping you looking and feeling clean and fresh now.

							<p class="card-text">Organic products do have a shorter shelf life, but that is for good
								reason.
								The preservatives used in
								non-organic products tend to be toxic to humans or the environment. It sometimes comes
								down
								to a choice: do
								you want the product to be able to sit, unused, on a shelf for a long time, or do you
								want
								it to be
								healthier for the user? The answer is clear.
